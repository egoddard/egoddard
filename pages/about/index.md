Hi! I'm Eric. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology and History, Masters of
Science in Earth Sciences, and a Graduate Certificate in GIS from the University
of Memphis. I started using Python around 2009 while collecting data for my thesis,
[Investigating Early Mississippian Community Patterning in the Mid-South through Multiple-Method Survey of the Ames Site (40FY7) in Fayette County, Tennessee](https://umwa.memphis.edu/etd/index.php/view/download/egoddard/440/egoddard_thesis.pdf).

I continued working with Python at the [Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research](http://strengthencommunities.com),
where I used Python for just about everything--automating GIS and remote sensing
processes, transforming data, data integrity checks, and web mapping applications built
on Django and Flask.

I'm currently a web developer at [Stratasan](http://stratasan.com), where I get
to work with Django every day.
